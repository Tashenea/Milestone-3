Reflection #4

Following the project of the Black Jack game I am struggling with trying to find my touch in computer programming. I dont want to 
switch majors to find out that Computer science is what I am missing. I love problem solving and love outputs that computer science
does for me. I just want to find myself in programming. I will for now on find more time to study programming. I would benefit from 
more group activities that can help me think of more computer science confidence. I learn better when I have a partner who can help 
guide me in thinking in computer science. Some of the concepts are helpful when I start early and finish early. I know I have what 
it takes to be in the top of the class I just need to apply myself even more.
